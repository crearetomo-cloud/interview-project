## Common Editing Issues

### Quotes

**Problem:** Quotes that are too long or rambling
**Solution:** Edit for clarity while maintaining meaning. Use ellipses (...) for omissions, brackets [ ] for clarifications.

**Example:**
- Original: "So, like, I was thinking about it, you know, and it was really hard, I mean, it was one of the hardest things I've ever done, but I knew I had to do it."
- Edited: "It was one of the hardest things I've ever done, but I knew I had to do it."

**Problem:** Quotes taken out of context
**Solution:** Ensure quotes accurately represent what was said and include necessary context.

### Transitions

**Problem:** Abrupt jumps between topics
**Solution:** Add transitional sentences or phrases.

**Example:**
- Weak: "John discussed his early career. He then talked about his current role."
- Better: "After establishing himself in the industry, John transitioned to his current role, where he focuses on..."

### Redundancy

**Problem:** Repeating the same information
**Solution:** Remove redundant sentences and combine similar points.

**Example:**
- Redundant: "Sarah built a successful company. Her business became very successful."
- Better: "Sarah built a successful company that..."

### Clarity

**Problem:** Unclear or confusing sentences
**Solution:** Simplify complex sentences, clarify ambiguous references.

**Example:**
- Unclear: "The thing that happened was that they did it because of the reason."
- Clear: "They made this decision because [specific reason]."

## Editing Techniques

### Read Aloud
Reading your work aloud helps identify:
- Awkward phrasing
- Run-on sentences
- Unnatural dialogue
- Flow issues

### Take Breaks
Step away from the piece for a few hours (or overnight) before final editing. Fresh eyes catch more errors.

### Print It Out
Editing on paper can help you see the piece differently and catch errors you missed on screen.

### Use Tools
- Grammar checkers (Grammarly, Hemingway)
- Spell checkers
- Readability analyzers
- But don't rely on them completely - use your judgment

## Style Guidelines

### Quotes
- Use quotation marks for direct quotes
- Use single quotes for quotes within quotes
- Maintain the speaker's voice
- Don't over-edit quotes (they should sound natural)

### Attribution
- Attribute quotes clearly
- Vary attribution placement (beginning, middle, end)
- Don't overuse "said" - vary with "explained," "noted," "shared," etc.

### Formatting
- Use subheadings to break up long sections
- Use bullet points or lists when appropriate
- Use italics for emphasis (sparingly)
- Use bold for key terms (sparingly)

### Length
- Blog posts: 800-2000 words typically
- Articles: 1500-3000 words
- Quick takes: 500-800 words
- Adjust based on platform and audience

## Fact-Checking

### Verify
- [ ] All names are spelled correctly
- [ ] Titles and roles are accurate
- [ ] Company names are correct
- [ ] Dates and numbers are accurate
- [ ] Claims can be verified
- [ ] Links work and go to correct pages

### When in Doubt
- Ask the interviewee to confirm
- Cross-reference with public sources
- Note if something is unclear or unverified

## Getting Feedback

### From Interviewee
- Send draft for review
- Ask specifically: "Please check for accuracy"
- Incorporate factual corrections
- Consider their feedback on tone/style

### From Editor/Peer
- Get a second set of eyes
- Ask specific questions: "Does this flow?" "Is this clear?"
- Be open to feedback
- But maintain your voice and vision
