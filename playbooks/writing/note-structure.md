# Note Structure Guide

## Purpose
Well-structured notes make transcription, writing, and editing much easier. This guide outlines best practices for organizing interview notes.

## Note-Taking Methods

### Real-Time Notes (During Interview)
- Focus on key points, not full sentences
- Use shorthand and abbreviations
- Note timestamps for important moments
- Capture direct quotes accurately
- Mark interesting tangents to revisit

### Post-Interview Notes (After Interview)
- Expand on real-time notes while fresh
- Fill in gaps from memory
- Organize by topic/theme
- Highlight key quotes and insights
- Note any follow-up questions needed

## Organizing by Theme

If the interview covers multiple themes, organize notes accordingly:

```
THEME 1: [Theme Name]
- Key points
- Quotes
- Stories
- Insights

THEME 2: [Theme Name]
- Key points
- Quotes
- Stories
- Insights
```

## Quote Management

### Marking Quotes
- Use quotation marks for direct quotes
- Note if it's a paraphrase vs. direct quote
- Include context for each quote
- Note the topic/question that prompted it

### Quote Categories
- **Opening quotes:** Great for article intros
- **Key insight quotes:** Core message quotes
- **Story quotes:** Narrative quotes
- **Closing quotes:** Strong ending quotes

## Timestamp Notes

If recording, note timestamps for:
- Key quotes
- Important stories
- Pivotal moments
- Sections to revisit

**Format:** `[MM:SS] - [Note]`

Example:
```
[05:23] - Great quote about challenges
[12:45] - Story about early days
[28:10] - Key insight about future
```

## Shorthand Tips

Develop your own shorthand, but common ones include:
- `→` for "leads to" or "results in"
- `*` for important points
- `Q:` for questions to follow up
- `!!` for very important points
- `?` for unclear points to clarify

## Digital vs. Handwritten

### Digital Notes
- Easier to search and organize
- Can be shared and edited
- Better for long-term storage
- Can include timestamps easily

### Handwritten Notes
- Less distracting during interview
- Can be more creative with formatting
- No battery/tech concerns
- Need to transcribe later

## Best Practices

1. **Take notes during, expand after**
2. **Focus on accuracy for quotes**
3. **Note context, not just content**
4. **Organize by theme when possible**
5. **Mark timestamps for recordings**
6. **Review notes within 24 hours**
7. **Fill in gaps while memory is fresh**

## Common Mistakes

- Trying to capture everything (focus on key points)
- Not noting context for quotes
- Waiting too long to expand notes
- Not organizing by theme
- Forgetting to note follow-up items
- Not marking direct quotes vs. paraphrases
