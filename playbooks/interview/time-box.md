## Time Management Strategies

### Before the Interview
- **Estimate time per question:** 2-5 minutes average
- **Prioritize questions:** Must-ask vs. nice-to-have
- **Plan buffer time:** Add 10-15% buffer for interesting tangents

### During the Interview
- **Start on time:** Respect the schedule
- **Monitor progress:** Check time at 25%, 50%, 75%
- **Adjust on the fly:** Skip lower-priority questions if needed
- **Give warnings:** "We have about 10 minutes left, let's cover..."

### Warning Signals
- **25% mark:** Should be through intro and 1-2 core questions
- **50% mark:** Should be through half of core questions
- **75% mark:** Should be wrapping up core questions
- **90% mark:** Should be in closing phase

## Sample 30-Minute Schedule

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 0:00-2:00 | Introductions, consent, small talk |
| 2:00-5:00 | Opening questions (background, context) |
| 5:00-20:00 | Core questions (main topics) |
| 20:00-27:00 | Deep dive on key points |
| 27:00-30:00 | Closing questions, wrap-up, thank you |

## Handling Time Overruns

### If Running Behind
- **Skip lower-priority questions**
- **Combine related questions**
- **Ask if they have 5 more minutes** (if appropriate)
- **Schedule a follow-up** if critical topics remain

### If Running Ahead
- **Ask follow-up questions** on interesting points
- **Explore tangents** that emerged
- **Ask "anything else to add?"** earlier
- **End early** if all key topics are covered (respect their time)

## Best Practices

1. **Set expectations upfront:** "This should take about 30 minutes"
2. **Be flexible:** Interesting tangents are valuable
3. **Respect boundaries:** Don't push if they need to go
4. **Plan for buffer:** Always have extra time scheduled
5. **Follow up if needed:** It's okay to ask one clarifying question via email

## Red Flags

- Going significantly over time without permission
- Rushing through important questions
- Not covering key topics due to poor time management
- Making the interviewee feel rushed or cut off

## Tools

- **Timer:** Use a visible timer (but don't make it obvious)
- **Agenda:** Share rough agenda if helpful
- **Reminders:** Set phone/calendar reminders
- **Buffer:** Always schedule 15 minutes after for notes
