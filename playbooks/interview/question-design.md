# Question Design Playbook

## Principles

### 1. Start Broad, Go Specific
Begin with open-ended questions, then drill down into specifics.

**Example:**
- "Tell me about your journey in [field]"
- "What was a pivotal moment in that journey?"
- "How did that moment change your approach?"

### 2. Use the "Why" Ladder
Ask "why" multiple times to get to deeper insights.

**Example:**
- "Why did you start this project?"
- "Why was that important to you?"
- "Why does that matter to your audience?"

### 3. Ask for Stories, Not Just Facts
Stories are more engaging than abstract concepts.

**Example:**
- Instead of: "What are your key principles?"
- Try: "Can you share a story that illustrates your approach?"

### 4. Use Follow-up Questions
Build on their answers rather than just moving to the next question.

**Example:**
- "That's interesting. Can you tell me more about [specific point]?"
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What did you learn from that experience?"

## Question Categories

### Opening Questions
- "Tell me about yourself and your work"
- "What are you most excited about right now?"
- "What's the story behind [specific project/achievement]?"

### Deep Dive Questions
- "What was the biggest challenge you faced?"
- "What surprised you most about [experience]?"
- "What would you do differently if you could?"

### Insight Questions
- "What's something most people don't understand about [topic]?"
- "What advice would you give to someone starting out?"
- "What's a common misconception you'd like to correct?"

### Closing Questions
- "What's next for you?"
- "What are you most looking forward to?"
- "Is there anything else you'd like to share?"

## Question Templates

### The "How" Question
"How did you [accomplish/achieve/overcome] [specific thing]?"

### The "What If" Question
"What if [scenario]? How would that change things?"

### The "Tell Me About" Question
"Tell me about a time when [specific situation]."

### The "What's Your Take" Question
"What's your take on [current trend/controversy]?"

### The "Behind the Scenes" Question
"What's something people don't know about [topic/process]?"

## Red Flags to Avoid

- Leading questions that suggest a desired answer
- Yes/no questions (unless followed by "why")
- Multiple questions in one (ask one at a time)
- Questions that are too personal or invasive
- Questions that show you haven't done research

## Tips

- Prepare 10-15 core questions, but be flexible
- Listen actively and ask follow-ups
- Don't be afraid of silence - let them think
- If they go off-topic, gently guide back
- Take notes on interesting points to revisit
- Ask for clarification if something is unclear
