# Interview Facilitation Tips

## Before the Interview

### Set the Tone
- Send a friendly confirmation message the day before
- Arrive/join a few minutes early
- Have your materials ready
- Test your equipment beforehand

### Create Comfort
- Start with small talk (2-3 minutes)
- Thank them for their time
- Acknowledge their expertise
- Set expectations clearly

## During the Interview

### Active Listening

**Show You're Listening:**
- Make eye contact (if video)
- Nod and use verbal affirmations ("I see," "That's interesting")
- Take notes (but don't let it distract)
- Avoid interrupting

**Demonstrate Understanding:**
- Paraphrase key points: "So what you're saying is..."
- Ask clarifying questions
- Reference earlier points: "Earlier you mentioned..."

### Managing the Flow

**Keep on Track:**
- Have your script/questions ready
- But be flexible - interesting tangents are valuable
- Gently redirect if they go too far off-topic
- Use transitions: "That's great. I'd love to shift to..."

**Time Management:**
- Start on time
- Keep an eye on the clock
- Give a 5-minute warning if needed
- Respect their time - don't go over

### Handling Challenges

**If They're Nervous:**
- Reassure them: "There are no wrong answers"
- Start with easy questions
- Acknowledge their expertise
- Create a conversational tone

**If They're Too Brief:**
- Ask follow-up questions
- Use prompts: "Can you tell me more about that?"
- Ask for examples or stories
- Use silence - sometimes they'll fill it

**If They're Too Verbose:**
- Politely interrupt: "That's really interesting, and I want to make sure we cover..."
- Use closed-ended questions to refocus
- Summarize and move on: "So to summarize, you're saying... Let's talk about..."

**If They're Evasive:**
- Rephrase the question
- Ask why the question is difficult
- Move on and come back to it later
- Respect boundaries

### Building Rapport

- Share a brief personal connection if relevant
- Show genuine interest in their answers
- Laugh at appropriate moments
- Be human, not just a question-asking machine

## After the Interview

### Closing Well
- Thank them sincerely
- Summarize what you learned
- Set expectations for next steps
- Offer to answer any questions they have

### Follow-up
- Send thank you within 24 hours
- Reference something specific from the conversation
- Keep them updated on progress
- Deliver on your promises

## Technical Tips

### Recording
- Always ask permission first
- Test your recording setup
- Have a backup recording method
- Save recordings immediately after

### Note-Taking
- Don't try to capture everything
- Focus on key quotes and insights
- Note timestamps for important moments
- Use shorthand to keep up

### Video Calls
- Ensure good lighting
- Minimize background distractions
- Test audio/video beforehand
- Have a backup plan if tech fails

2. **Be genuinely curious**
3. **Respect their time and expertise**
4. **Be prepared but flexible**
5. **Follow through on commitments**
